    <h2>The story behind</h2>
    <h3>Alternative Rock</h3>
    <p>
        Alternative rock, or alt-rock, is a category of rock music that emerged from 
        the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 
        1990s. "Alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial 
        rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians 
        influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock.</p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional 
        roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth 
        had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct 
        styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In 
        September 1988, Billboard introduced "alternative" into their charting system to reflect 
        the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM 
        in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, 
        independent, and non-commercial rock artists</p>

                <h4>Foo Fighters</h4>
                <p>Foo Fighters is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. 
                    Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former 
                    Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Following the success of the 1995 
                    eponymous debut album, Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a 
                    band consisting of Nate Mendel (bass guitar), William Goldsmith (drums), 
                    and Pat Smear (guitar). The band formed its core lineup in 1999, consisting 
                    of Grohl, Mendel, Chris Shiflett (guitar), and Taylor Hawkins (drums). 
                    Smear rejoined in 2005, and Rami Jaffee (keys) joined in 2017</p>

                <h5>What's in the name?</h5>
                <p>“Foo fighter” was a term first coined by the United States Air Force during 
                    World War II. It referred to strange phenomena or unidentified flying objects 
                    in the sky before it was replaced by the acronym “UFO.”</p>

                <h4>Green Day</h4>
                <p>Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 
                    1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist 
                    and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day 
                    was called Sweet Children, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area 
                    punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. 
                    The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. 
                    In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became 
                    a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside 
                    multi bands, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk 
                    rock in the U.S.</p>
                <h5>What's in the name?</h5>
                <p>The band adopted the name Green Day, due to the members' fondness for cannabis. 
                    The phrase, "Green day", was slang in the Bay Area, where the band originated, 
                    for spending a day doing nothing but smoking marijuana.</p>
