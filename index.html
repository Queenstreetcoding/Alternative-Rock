    <h3>Alternative Rock</h3>
    <p>
        Alternative rock, or alt-rock, is a category of rock music that emerged from 
        the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 
        1990s. "Alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial 
        rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians 
        influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock.</p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional 
        roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth 
        had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct 
        styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In 
        September 1988, Billboard introduced "alternative" into their charting system to reflect 
        the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM 
        in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, 
        independent, and non-commercial rock artists</p>
